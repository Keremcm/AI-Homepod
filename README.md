Voice Assistant with Calendar, Timer, Alarm, Weather, and Location Features

This is a Python-based voice assistant project that includes various functionalities like voice recognition, calendar management, alarms, timers, weather information, and location-based services. The assistant uses speech recognition to understand commands and responds using text-to-speech.
Features

    Voice Recognition: The assistant listens for user commands and converts speech to text using Google Speech Recognition API.
    Calendar Management: Add events to the calendar and check for events on a specific day.
    Alarms: Set one-time or recurring alarms with user-specified times.
    Timer & Stopwatch: Start timers and stopwatches, and notify the user when time has elapsed.
    Weather Information: Fetch the weather for the user's location using the OpenWeatherMap API.
    Location-Based Services: Retrieve the user's location using their public IP address and provide related information such as city, region, and country.

Requirements

    Python 3.x
    pyaudio
    pygame
    speechrecognition
    gtts (Google Text-to-Speech)
    requests
    cryptography
    numpy
    g4f (for G4F API client)
    datetime

Installation

    Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/voice-assistant.git

Install the necessary dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

    You will also need to create and add your own OpenWeatherMap API key in the weather function.

    Set up the environment for the microphone and speech recognition on your system.

How to Use

    Starting the Assistant: The assistant will start listening for voice commands when it detects noise above a certain threshold.
    Voice Commands:
        Set a Calendar Event: Say "Set an event" to add an event with a specific date and description.
        Check Events: Say "What is today's event?" to check if there is an event for today.
        Set an Alarm: Say "Set an alarm" and provide a time for the alarm.
        Weather Information: Say "What's the weather like?" to get the current weather for your location.
        Start Timer: Say "Start a timer" followed by the duration (in minutes or seconds).
        Start Stopwatch: Say "Start stopwatch" to start a stopwatch.
        Stop Stopwatch: Say "Stop stopwatch" to stop the stopwatch.
